# Outdoor Gear Bank
*A Simple Way to Manage Your Rental Gear*

This application provides a way for businesses to keep track of where their rental gear is at any state in the process. Any company that provides a rental service would benefit from the usage of this application.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to move the rental process of a local outdoor company away from being entirely pen and paper.

Before this application, each department had a binder keeping track of the gear currently out for rent. The store also had no process for keeping tabs on gear that needed maintenance and what maintenance it may need. This application solves both of these problems by moving inventory between three stages: "Available, Out for Rent, and In Maintenance."

## Further Development
- A feature for inputing a date range when an item is rented out by a customer, thus allowing the user to pull up information on items that are due "today" or items that are "overdue."
- Utilizing Modals on Return, Maintenance, and Inventory page for further UI/UX development.
- Breaking the code down to more components with less code within pages & components.
